Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of this study is to develop a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) for in-vehicle networks that effectively classifies different types of cyber-attacks, specifically addressing multiclass classification problems. The authors propose a supervised contrastive learning-based ResNet model (SupCon ResNet) integrated with transfer learning techniques to enhance detection capabilities across different car models using limited datasets, aiming for efficiency and adaptability.
Working Principle

The system utilizes supervised contrastive learning (SupCon), which learns robust feature representations by maximizing similarity among same-class samples and minimizing similarity across different classes. It combines this with a compact ResNet-18 architecture to capture subtle patterns in Controller Area Network (CAN) message sequences. Additionally, transfer learning is applied to generalize this knowledge effectively to new vehicle models with limited data.
Workflow

The workflow involves two main stages: supervised contrastive learning and transfer learning. Initially, CAN ID sequences from a source dataset are processed, labeled, and fed into the SupCon ResNet model to learn discriminative features through contrastive loss. In the second stage, the encoder from the trained source model is fine-tuned using smaller datasets from different target vehicle models, facilitating quick adaptation and high detection accuracy in new vehicles.
Methodology

The authors proposed SupCon ResNet, employing supervised contrastive loss instead of traditional cross-entropy loss. A ResNet-18 encoder generates feature embeddings, followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection network that refines these features. A linear classifier finalizes the classification task. Transfer learning is achieved by initially freezing the pretrained encoder weights and subsequently fine-tuning the entire model with limited target data, thus overcoming data scarcity.
Datasets

The experiments utilized two publicly available datasets: the Car Hacking dataset (collected from Hyundai Sonata) and the Survival dataset (including Hyundai Sonata, KIA Soul, and Chevrolet Spark). The Car Hacking dataset contains normal and four attack types (DoS, fuzzy, spoofing RPM, and spoofing gear), whereas the Survival dataset includes normal, DoS, fuzzy, and malfunction attacks.
Key Findings

The SupCon ResNet significantly reduces the false-negative rates (FNR) across multiple attack types. Specifically, the average FNR is reduced by nearly five times compared to the baseline ResNet trained with cross-entropy loss. Furthermore, using transfer learning, the SupCon ResNet model achieves superior performance on target datasets (KIA Soul and Chevrolet Spark), demonstrating robust generalization capabilities.
Advantages

The proposed approach substantially improves attack classification accuracy with fewer false negatives and higher F1 scores. It effectively addresses the issue of limited training data through transfer learning, significantly reducing the need for large datasets from each car model. Additionally, the compact ResNet architecture provides lower computational costs and faster inference speeds suitable for real-time deployment.
Limitations

One notable limitation is that the proposed system cannot inherently detect unknown or novel attack types, as it strictly relies on supervised learning methods. Consequently, the model requires continuous updates with new labeled data to maintain effectiveness against emerging threats, highlighting a gap in adaptability to unknown scenarios.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to existing methods such as Histogram-based KNN, Inception ResNet, Rec-CNN, and transformer-based models, the proposed SupCon ResNet achieves lower false-negative rates and higher F1 scores. Particularly, it outperforms in multiclass classification scenarios, showing superior results compared to previous models that primarily addressed binary classification tasks. Additionally, it is more efficient in terms of computational complexity compared to transformer-based models.
Conclusion

The study concludes that the proposed SupCon ResNet effectively addresses multiclass classification for in-vehicle intrusion detection systems, reducing false-negative rates and significantly enhancing transfer learning capabilities. It emphasizes the potential for practical deployment due to its lightweight and fast-processing architecture. Future research directions include incorporating online retrainable neural network methods to detect unknown attack types and further enhance adaptability.
