Main Idea and Purpose:

The primary goal of this study is to enhance the intrusion detection capabilities of Controller Area Networks (CAN) in vehicles through an efficient on-device transfer learning approach, named CAN-ODTL. This method addresses the challenge of requiring large benign datasets for training Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by enabling incremental retraining using streaming data on resource-constrained devices, thus significantly improving intrusion detection in real-time vehicle network environments.
Working Principle:

CAN-ODTL operates using an incremental transfer learning mechanism that retrains only the classification layer of a shallow neural network. It employs GRU-based context modeling and self-attention mechanisms to improve accuracy. The model is optimized for deployment on a Raspberry Pi through data preprocessing optimization and model quantization (specifically float 16 quantization) to reduce computational load and memory usage.
Workflow:

The workflow involves:

    Initial training on a large benign dataset.

    Deploying the trained model on Raspberry Pi connected to the CAN bus.

    Streaming CAN data used for incremental retraining of the classification layer on-device.

    Model quantization and optimization for inference.

    Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection based on thresholds and observation windows.

Methodology:

The study employs transfer learning by retraining the classification layer using incoming CAN data streams on-device. It uses an embedding layer, a GRU layer, a self-attention mechanism, and a softmax classification layer. Quantization (float 16) reduces model complexity for efficient real-time execution. Anomaly detection involves softmax probability thresholds and window-based anomaly counting to reduce false positives.
Datasets:

The Real ORNL Automotive Dynamometer (ROAD) dataset was utilized, containing realistic benign driving scenarios and various CAN attacks including fuzzing, speedometer manipulation, and masquerade attacks. This dataset covers a wide range of realistic driving behaviors and verified attack scenarios.
Key Findings:

    CAN-ODTL achieved over 99% detection accuracy for various realistic attack scenarios.

    The incremental retraining significantly reduced false-positive rates compared to pre-trained models.

    Model quantization resulted in a 78% reduction in model size and 83% improvement in inference speed on Raspberry Pi.

    Detection latency was around 125ms, appropriate for near-real-time applications.

Advantages:

    The approach significantly reduces memory usage and computational overhead, making it feasible for real-time, resource-constrained in-vehicle environments.

    Incremental training effectively adapts to new benign behaviors, continuously improving detection accuracy without needing massive datasets initially.

    High detection accuracy with very low false-positive rates ensures reliability in practical automotive applications.

Limitations:

    Initial model training still requires a representative dataset covering diverse benign driving behaviors.

    Quantization techniques can slightly reduce the model's numerical precision, potentially affecting very sensitive detections.

    The performance and required training duration may vary significantly depending on specific vehicle architectures and driving conditions.

Comparison with Related Work:

Compared to existing methods such as CAN-CID, CAN-ODTL shows improved or equivalent detection capabilities with fewer model parameters and lower latency. The inclusion of transfer learning and optimized quantization provides practical advantages over purely pre-trained or full retraining models, especially in resource-constrained deployments.
Conclusion:

CAN-ODTL effectively enhances CAN IDS through incremental on-device transfer learning and quantization, achieving near-real-time anomaly detection with high accuracy and low latency. Future directions include deploying the proposed model in real vehicles to validate performance under actual operational conditions and potential attacks.
