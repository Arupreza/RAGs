Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of the study is to develop an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Controller Area Networks (CAN) in vehicles using a hybrid transfer learning approach. The motivation stems from the significant vulnerabilities in CAN networks, such as lack of authentication and encryption, making them susceptible to various attacks like DoS, spoofing, replay, and fuzzy attacks. The proposed system aims to overcome the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods, such as the extensive requirement of labeled datasets and high computational costs.
Working Principle

The study employs a hybrid deep learning approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. CNNs extract spatial features from CAN data, while LSTMs capture temporal dependencies, improving the detection of sequential and correlated attack patterns. Transfer learning (TL) is then used, leveraging previously trained knowledge to efficiently recognize new attack patterns without retraining the entire model from scratch.
Workflow

The workflow consists of multiple stages: initially preprocessing and feature extraction from raw CAN messages, followed by the development of a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model trained on a large source dataset. After establishing the model, transfer learning is applied to adapt it to new datasets with different attack patterns. Fine-tuning optimizes the pre-trained layers alongside new classifier layers to quickly learn features from new attacks, reducing computational costs.
Methodology

The specific methodology includes transforming CAN message data into a normalized image-like format to facilitate CNN processing. The CNN-LSTM hybrid model architecture comprises convolution, pooling, LSTM layers, and dense fully connected layers. Training employs a substantial source dataset followed by the implementation of transfer learning, which reuses learned features from the source model and fine-tunes specific layers for detecting new attacks in smaller, target datasets.
Datasets

Two primary datasets were used:

    The "Car-Hacking Dataset," including normal CAN messages and simulated attacks (DoS, fuzzy, RPM spoofing, gear spoofing).

    The "Car Hacking: Attack and Defense Challenge 2020" dataset, containing attacks like flooding, spoofing, replay, and fuzzing conducted on a real Hyundai vehicle using Raspberry Pi devices connected through the OBD-II port.

Key Findings

The hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieved superior detection accuracy, approximately 99.9% for both datasets, effectively identifying fuzzy attacks and other intrusion types. The transfer learning approach notably reduced both training and testing times by more than 30% compared to traditional models. The study demonstrated that the proposed method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving near-perfect detection rates.
Advantages

The primary strengths of this approach are its high detection accuracy, rapid adaptability to new attack types through transfer learning, and significantly reduced training/testing times. The system efficiently handles dynamic datasets, enhancing the practical feasibility of deploying deep learning-based IDS in vehicular environments. It also addresses the challenge of dataset scarcity by effectively utilizing smaller labeled datasets.
Limitations

Despite its strengths, the study faces challenges in generalizing to very different or future unknown attack patterns without initial examples. The reliance on image-like input conversion of CAN data might introduce additional computational overhead. Additionally, the requirement of initial large-scale labeled datasets for pre-training might still pose practical limitations in real-world scenarios where data privacy and availability are concerns.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to earlier works, such as those using only CNNs, LSTMs, or GAN-based models, this study's hybrid CNN-LSTM approach with transfer learning achieved higher accuracy and efficiency. Previous methods either required significantly more data or faced higher computational complexity, limiting their real-time applicability. This work specifically addresses these drawbacks and demonstrates better adaptability and accuracy.
Conclusion

The final takeaway is the effectiveness of combining hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures with transfer learning to create an efficient, highly accurate IDS for CAN networks. This model provides robust detection of diverse attacks and significantly reduces computational resources required for IDS implementation. Future directions include extending the method to handle more sophisticated attack scenarios and real-world deployment validationsâ€‹
