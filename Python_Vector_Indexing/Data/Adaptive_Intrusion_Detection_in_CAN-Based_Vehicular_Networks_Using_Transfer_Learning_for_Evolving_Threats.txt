Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of this study is to propose an adaptive and reconfigurable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) specifically tailored for Controller Area Network (CAN)-based vehicular networks. The motivation is to address evolving cybersecurity threats in increasingly connected automotive environments. The system leverages transfer learning (TL) to quickly adapt to new attack patterns, ensuring high accuracy and low computational overhead.
Working Principle

The IDS integrates multiple machine learning methods, primarily focusing on hybrid CNN-LSTM, RNN, Random Forest, and particularly hybrid transfer learning. The system dynamically adapts pre-trained CNN models fine-tuned with specific automotive datasets, enabling effective detection of both known and emerging threats with minimal retraining.
Workflow

The key workflow includes data collection and preprocessing (cleaning, feature extraction, normalization, augmentation), model design (hybrid CNN-LSTM, hybrid transfer learning, RNN, and Random Forest), continuous reconfiguration (retraining to adapt new threats), and real-time deployment. This process ensures the system remains effective against evolving threat vectors.
Methodology

A hybrid model approach is employed, combining CNN for spatial feature extraction, LSTM for temporal dependencies, and transfer learning for rapid adaptation. Random Forest serves as a complementary baseline, while continuous reconfiguration maintains model relevance. The models were trained using cross-entropy loss and optimized using Adam optimizer, with techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Datasets

The study utilizes the Car-Hacking dataset, containing a range of CAN traffic attack scenarios including DoS, Fuzzy attack, RPM spoofing, and gear spoofing. This dataset consists of millions of messages representing both normal and attack conditions, allowing comprehensive training and evaluation of the IDS models.
Key Findings

The models achieved an overall detection accuracy of over 99%. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score demonstrated the robustness of the proposed IDS against various attack types. Specifically, the hybrid transfer learning model showed exceptional adaptability and accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of combining deep learning methods with transfer learning in IDS contexts.
Advantages

The primary strengths of the proposed IDS include its adaptability to new threats, high detection accuracy (>99%), and computational efficiency due to minimal retraining needs. The integration of CNN-LSTM, transfer learning, and continuous reconfiguration further enhances its ability to promptly respond to evolving threats.
Limitations

A potential limitation is the dependency on the availability and quality of pre-trained models and datasets. Additionally, real-time adaptability and deployment effectiveness in complex and varied automotive scenarios might pose practical challenges requiring further validation and fine-tuning.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to traditional static IDS methods, this work provides significant improvements through its adaptive nature facilitated by transfer learning. It extends the capabilities demonstrated by previous works, offering a more robust and generalized approach to emerging threats in automotive cybersecurity.
Conclusion

The study concludes that adaptive and reconfigurable IDS using hybrid deep learning and transfer learning techniques provides an effective solution to protect vehicular networks from evolving cybersecurity threats. Future research directions suggested include developing advanced model variants, extensive real-world testing, and integration with other security strategies to enhance overall vehicular cybersecurity robustnessâ€‹
