Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of this study is to enhance security on in-vehicle Controller Area Networks (CAN) by addressing vulnerabilities such as DoS, Fuzzing, and Spoofing attacks. The motivation stems from the inherent lack of encryption and authentication mechanisms in CAN, posing risks to vehicle safety and reliability. The authors propose HybridSecNet, a novel two-step machine learning model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to effectively detect and classify intrusions.
Working Principle

HybridSecNet operates in two distinct stages. Initially, it employs an LSTM-based binary classifier to determine whether CAN bus data is normal or malicious. Upon detecting an attack, the second stage uses a CNN-based classifier to accurately categorize the intrusion into specific types (DoS, Fuzzy, Gear, or RPM attacks). The hybrid architecture leverages LSTM's temporal relationship capturing capabilities and CNN's spatial feature extraction strengths.
Workflow

The workflow involves preprocessing CAN bus data through window sliding and hexadecimal-to-decimal conversion, followed by normalization. Initially, the LSTM model classifies inputs into normal or attack categories. If an attack is detected, the data proceeds to the CNN stage, which further categorizes the attack type. This two-step classification enables precise detection and effective utilization of computational resources by avoiding unnecessary CNN activation for non-attacked inputs.
Methodology

The research uses a stacked LSTM model with two layers (64 and 32 units) optimized with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, employing a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The CNN model includes Conv1D layers with ReLU activation, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, and Dense layers, trained using categorical cross-entropy loss. Algorithm 1 transforms the predictions back to their original format for evaluation.
Datasets

The Car Hacking Dataset was employed, consisting of CAN bus data captured via an OBD-II port. The dataset includes different types of injection attacks (DoS, Fuzzy, Gear, RPM) labeled clearly for supervised learning. Each dataset contains around 300 attack instances with durations of 3-5 seconds and overall recording times of 30-40 minutes, providing a rich dataset for robust model training and testing.
Key Findings

The proposed HybridSecNet achieved exceptional performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score all approximately 99.5%. Comparative evaluations demonstrated that HybridSecNet significantly outperformed both single-step models (CNN-only) and existing multi-step models, highlighting the benefit of combining temporal and spatial feature extraction methods through LSTM and CNN, respectively.
Advantages

HybridSecNet's two-step approach enhances computational efficiency and resource optimization by invoking the computationally intensive second step (CNN-based classification) only when an intrusion is initially detected by the first step (LSTM-based detection). This leads to faster, more efficient data processing. The combined model also ensures high accuracy and robustness in detecting and categorizing multiple attack types.
Limitations

Despite high accuracy, HybridSecNet requires precise tuning of hyperparameters such as the LSTM window size and CNN architecture details, demanding significant initial experimentation. The model's reliance on supervised learning also necessitates extensive, accurately labeled data, potentially limiting flexibility in rapidly adapting to novel or evolving attack types not seen in training.
Comparison with Related Work

HybridSecNet was rigorously compared against existing methods, such as single-step CNN-based models and other two-stage IDS models (e.g., rule extraction and Bloom filter-based architectures). It demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This highlights the effectiveness of combining LSTM and CNN for intrusion detection in comparison to existing rule-based or probabilistic methods.
Conclusion

HybridSecNet offers a robust, efficient solution for detecting and classifying intrusions in vehicle CAN systems. Its innovative two-step hybrid approach significantly surpasses traditional IDS techniques. The study suggests that future research could explore extending HybridSecNet's capabilities to address emerging threats and integrate real-time detection features more deeply into vehicle security systems, paving the way for safer intelligent vehicle networks
