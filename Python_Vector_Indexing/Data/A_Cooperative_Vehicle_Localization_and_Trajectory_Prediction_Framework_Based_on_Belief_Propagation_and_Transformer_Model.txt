Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of the study is to develop a cooperative vehicle localization and trajectory prediction framework to improve Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The motivation comes from limitations of existing GNSS-based methods, which suffer accuracy issues in complex environments. The framework addresses these challenges by integrating a Belief Propagation based Location Approximation (BPLA) and a Transformer-based trajectory prediction model (VFormer) for enhanced accuracy and prediction reliability​

.
Working Principle

The framework combines two core mechanisms: BPLA and VFormer. BPLA utilizes sensor data (GNSS, inertial sensors, and ranging sensors) to form a factor graph, using belief propagation to iteratively estimate accurate vehicle positions. VFormer, a transformer-based model, employs historical trajectories and inertial data, leveraging multi-head attention mechanisms to predict future trajectories by learning spatial-temporal relationships among vehicles​

.
Workflow

The workflow includes several key steps: sensor measurement collection (GNSS, inertial, ranging), timestamp synchronization, and data association at a Roadside Unit (RSU). Data then feeds into the BPLA algorithm to refine vehicle positions. Subsequently, refined historical trajectories and inertial measurements serve as inputs to the VFormer model, which outputs predicted future vehicle positions​

.
Methodology

The methodology involves two main approaches. First, the BPLA algorithm constructs a factor graph representing vehicle positions as variables connected to sensor measurements as factors, applying a modified two-phase belief propagation for forward and backward position refinement. Second, VFormer utilizes multi-head attention and positional encodings to capture temporal-spatial interactions among vehicles for robust trajectory prediction​

.
Datasets

Experiments used two public vehicle trajectory datasets: the Intersection Drone (inD) and Highway Drone (highD), which provide naturalistic trajectory data of vehicles at intersections and highways. Additionally, real-world tests utilized remotely controlled wheel robots equipped with LiDAR, GNSS, and inertial sensors on a campus road, validating practical implementation​

.
Key Findings

The proposed framework significantly improved vehicle localization accuracy compared to GNSS-only methods, with localization error reductions of over 80%. The BPLA showed superior accuracy compared to particle filter (PF) and MSMV methods, while VFormer consistently outperformed baseline trajectory prediction models, particularly in noisy measurement scenarios, showing robust performance across various localization error levels and prediction intervals​
​

.
Advantages

The approach offers substantial strengths, including improved localization accuracy through cooperative sensing and trajectory refinement via backward belief propagation. VFormer benefits from multi-head attention, effectively capturing complex spatial-temporal vehicle interactions, demonstrating robustness against noisy inputs, and providing accurate long-term predictions​
​

.
Limitations

Limitations include the computational overhead associated with the transformer model (VFormer), which demands significantly higher training and inference times compared to simpler LSTM-based models. Additionally, real-world performance slightly degraded compared to simulations, attributed mainly to fewer cooperative vehicles available during practical tests​
​

.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to prior studies, the BPLA algorithm uniquely incorporates a two-phase (forward and backward) belief propagation for historical trajectory refinement, surpassing simpler particle filter and MSMV methods in accuracy. The VFormer model improves upon earlier LSTM and attention-based models by effectively integrating historical acceleration data and spatial-temporal multi-head attention, achieving superior predictive performance​
​

.
Conclusion

The study concludes that the proposed framework significantly enhances localization and prediction accuracy, suggesting practical applicability in real-world ITS scenarios. Future research directions include integrating communication delay modeling and enhancing the factor graph by including trajectory predictions as additional variables, aiming for even tighter integration between localization and prediction processes
