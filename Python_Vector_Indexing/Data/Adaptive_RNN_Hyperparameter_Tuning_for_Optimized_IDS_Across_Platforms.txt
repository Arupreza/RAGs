Main Idea and Purpose:

The primary goal of this study is to enhance the performance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in automotive networks by utilizing optimized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The motivation arises from the vulnerability of modern vehicles' Controller Area Networks (CAN), which lack encryption and authentication. The study aims to identify optimal hyperparameters and RNN architectures for efficient detection across different hardware platforms.
Working Principle:

The core mechanism involves employing three types of RNN architectures—SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU—to analyze sequential CAN data. These networks leverage sequential dependencies in data to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats. The hyperparameters (optimizers, learning rates, hidden layer configurations) are systematically tuned to maximize detection accuracy while minimizing inference times.
Workflow:

The workflow includes data collection from the CAN bus, preprocessing (mean normalization and sequential formatting), hyperparameter tuning through grid search, and model training across three RNN types. Subsequently, models are rigorously tested on multiple hardware platforms (Jetson series, Raspberry Pi, and a PC). The best-performing configurations are selected based on accuracy and inference speed metrics.
Methodology:

The methodology encompasses feature extraction from CAN IDs and time intervals, data preprocessing using LabelEncoder and normalization, and time-series input formatting. Models undergo hyperparameter optimization via a grid search strategy to identify the best configuration. Performance evaluations include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and inference times on diverse hardware setups.
Datasets:

The study uses the HCRL dataset derived from real KIA SOUL vehicle CAN data. This dataset includes normal operation data and four attack scenarios: Denial-of-Service (DoS), Fuzzing, Replay, and Malfunction. The key features extracted are "Time offset" and "CAN ID," reflecting the priority and timing of CAN message transmissions.
Key Findings:

The study finds that GRU-based models significantly outperform SimpleRNN and slightly outperform LSTM models in terms of accuracy (achieving approximately 99%) and computational efficiency. Optimal hyperparameter configurations (especially using Nadam and AdamW optimizers at a learning rate of 0.001) are essential to maximizing IDS performance across various hardware, notably achieving robust results even on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi.
Advantages:

The advantages of the proposed approach include high detection accuracy across multiple attack types, efficient inference times suitable for real-time detection, and strong adaptability across diverse hardware platforms. Particularly, GRU networks demonstrate a superior balance between computational demands and detection performance, making them ideal for embedded automotive systems.
Limitations:

Despite its strengths, the approach faces challenges detecting replay attacks, achieving slightly lower accuracy (94%) due to their similarity with normal traffic. Additionally, the inference performance variability across different hardware platforms necessitates careful hyperparameter tuning, particularly for low-power devices to achieve real-time operation without compromising accuracy.
Comparison with Related Work:

Compared to prior research, this study stands out by extensively evaluating multiple RNN architectures and hyperparameter combinations across several IoT platforms rather than only on high-powered PCs. While previous works focused on limited hardware and feature extraction processes, this paper systematically demonstrates the broader applicability and superior efficiency of GRU models through rigorous validation.
Conclusion:

The final takeaway is that GRU-based RNNs with carefully selected hyperparameters provide the best solution for automotive IDS, balancing accuracy, inference speed, and resource usage effectively. Future directions include further lightweight IDS model development tailored to specific hardware architectures and the exploration of advanced approaches such as federated learning and encrypted communication integration to enhance IDS resilience further​
