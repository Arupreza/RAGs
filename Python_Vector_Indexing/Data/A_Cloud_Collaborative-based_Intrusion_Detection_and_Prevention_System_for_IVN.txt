Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of the study is to propose a Cloud Collaborative-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (CC-IDPS) to address security threats in modern intelligent vehicles. With increasing connectivity through the Internet-of-Vehicle (IoV), vehicles face heightened risks of cyber-attacks on their In-Vehicle Networks (IVN). The CC-IDPS aims to leverage cloud computing resources to effectively identify and mitigate these threats, overcoming the limitations of computational resources within vehicles.
Working Principle

The CC-IDPS utilizes cloud computing resources to train an advanced Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to classify in-vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN) traffic. The system operates by extracting CAN ID features via a sliding window mechanism, encoding malicious traffic through a unique Encode2ID algorithm, and periodically updating its detection models based on the latest traffic data, thus maintaining the robustness against emerging threats.
Workflow

The workflow involves four key stages: data collection and preprocessing in a cloud environment, feature engineering with a sliding window for CAN ID extraction, model training and classification using a BERT model, and feedback with defensive actions. Vehicles upload CAN traffic data to the cloud, which processes and classifies traffic, returning updates and instructions for local defensive actions to prevent intrusion.
Methodology

The study uses a combination of real-world vehicle CAN data and simulated scenarios integrated into a new dataset named the In-Vehicle Attack Dataset (IVAD). The methodology includes training a BERT-based model with tokenized CAN traffic data, employing masked language modeling for pre-training, and fine-tuning for binary classification to detect malicious traffic. Additionally, novel algorithms Encode2ID and DecodeID are implemented to securely encode and decode malicious traffic data.
Datasets

The research introduces the IVAD dataset, constructed from publicly available datasets like the Car Hacking Dataset (CHD) and Survival Analysis Dataset (SAD), along with newly collected real-world and simulated CAN traffic data. IVAD covers diverse attack scenarios including DoS, randomized DoS, combination, masquerade, fuzzy, replay, gear spoof, RPM spoof, and malfunction attacks, making it highly comprehensive and challenging for intrusion detection systems.
Key Findings

The experimental results reveal that the CC-IDPS significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models and other deep learning models tested, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. Particularly, it demonstrated strong capabilities in detecting both known and unknown types of attacks, and its cloud-vehicle collaborative design substantially reduces the computational burden on vehicles, enhancing real-time detection capability.
Advantages

The main strengths include leveraging cloud computing for handling extensive data processing and model training, the adaptability of the BERT model for capturing complex contextual relationships within CAN traffic, and real-time updating capability. The Encode2ID algorithm provides space-efficient and secure storage for malicious data, significantly improving storage efficiency compared to traditional encryption methods.
Limitations

Despite high performance, the CC-IDPS exhibits challenges related to network latency and dependency on continuous communication between vehicles and cloud servers. While it maintains a low latency within a small local network (around 3 ms), practical deployments involving larger or more complex networks might experience increased latency, impacting detection performance and response time.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to previous works such as CNN-LSTM and various ResNet models, CC-IDPS provides a more stable and consistently higher performance on updated and unknown datasets, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. Unlike other approaches, CC-IDPS uniquely integrates cloud resources for continuous model training, updates, and employs comprehensive feedback mechanisms for immediate defensive actions.
Conclusion

The study concludes that the proposed CC-IDPS effectively addresses current IVN security challenges through innovative use of cloud resources, advanced feature extraction methods, and real-time model updates. It significantly enhances detection accuracy and efficiency, positioning itself as a robust solution for securing future intelligent vehicle systems.
