Main Idea and Purpose:

The primary goal of the study is to develop a novel privacy preservation method, named cross-bucket generalization, that provides separate protection for identity and sensitive information in microdata. The motivation is to avoid the limitations of traditional methods (generalization and bucketization), which either cause overprotection of identity or fail to adequately prevent identity disclosure.
Working Principle:

Cross-bucket generalization operates by partitioning data into equivalence groups to protect identity, then further dividing these groups into buckets to protect sensitive attributes separately. This mechanism allows flexible adjustment of protection levels, minimizing unnecessary loss of data utility while still satisfying k-anonymity and l-diversity requirements.
Workflow:

The workflow involves three main steps: (1) Calculating the sensitive value set; (2) Selecting appropriate tuples based on sensitive sets; (3) Dividing the selected tuples into equivalence groups (for identity protection) and buckets (for attribute protection). These steps iteratively minimize the size of groups and buckets, reducing information loss.
Methodology:

The study presents algorithms for cross-bucket generalization, specifically designed to achieve (k, l)-anonymity. It employs an adapted Mondrian algorithm for tuple selection and uses specific generalization and partitioning algorithms to enforce anonymity constraints effectively. The algorithms systematically minimize the sizes of groups and buckets to limit disclosure probabilities.
Datasets:

The experiments utilize real-world US Census data comprising 22,517 tuples, each having nine attributes including categorical and continuous quasi-identifiers (e.g., sex, age, occupation) and one sensitive attribute (salary).
Key Findings:

Experimental results demonstrate that cross-bucket generalization significantly reduces the disclosure probability of sensitive values compared to traditional approaches like Mondrian (generalization) and Anatomy (bucketization). It also achieves better information utility as measured by discernibility and query-answerability metrics, maintaining low error rates in aggregate queries.
Advantages:

Cross-bucket generalization effectively separates identity and sensitive attribute protections, allowing each to be optimized independently. It avoids overprotection, significantly reducing information loss, and ensures flexibility to adjust protection levels based on actual demands. The method also enhances privacy protection and improves the utility of anonymized data.
Limitations:

One notable limitation is the complexity of accurately balancing identity and attribute protection, particularly in datasets with highly diverse sensitive attributes or very stringent privacy requirements. Computational overhead might increase for larger datasets or higher anonymity levels, potentially impacting efficiency.
Comparison with Related Work:

Compared to earlier techniques, cross-bucket generalization uniquely addresses the drawbacks of traditional generalization and bucketization methods by separating identity and attribute protections. Unlike general bucketization approaches, this method also prevents identity disclosures, thus effectively reducing the risk of re-identification attacks.
Conclusion:

Cross-bucket generalization emerges as a highly effective privacy preservation technique for data publication, balancing robust identity and attribute protections with minimal data utility loss. Future directions include extending this approach to continuous data publication and personalized privacy scenarios, as well as optimizing computational efficiency for large-scale applications
