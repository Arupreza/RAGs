Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of the study is to improve the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for Controller Area Network (CAN) buses in vehicles by overcoming data scarcity challenges. The authors propose CANPerFL, a personalized federated learning approach, to aggregate knowledge across different car manufacturers, enhancing detection performance without compromising data privacy.
Working Principle

CANPerFL utilizes personalized federated learning, where individual car manufacturers jointly train a global model on distributed datasets without sharing raw data. This global model captures generalizable features across different vehicles and is subsequently fine-tuned locally, ensuring that each manufacturer benefits from global knowledge while maintaining data confidentiality.
Workflow

The workflow includes three main steps:

    Global Training: Each client locally trains the shared model on their data and shares only model weights with a central server.

    Aggregation: The central server aggregates these weights to update the global model.

    Personalized Fine-Tuning: Each client downloads the global model and further fine-tunes it locally for optimized performance on their specific dataset.

Methodology

The authors implemented CANPerFL using the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm combined with fine-tuning. Data preprocessing involved stacking sequential CAN IDs into matrices. The classification utilized a compact ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for computational efficiency and accuracy.
Datasets

Real CAN bus data were collected from three car models: Kia, BMW, and Tesla. The dataset consisted of both normal and attack scenarios (Fuzzing and Replay attacks), with around 50,000 samples for each vehicle after preprocessing and balancing the dataset to maintain realistic attack densities.
Key Findings

CANPerFL significantly improved the performance of local IDS models. Notably, the F1 scores increased by an average of 4% compared to baseline local models. The federated learning approach showed a substantial benefit, especially when local datasets were small, achieving F1 scores exceeding 90% with as few as 30,000 training samples per client.
Advantages

    Enhanced Performance: Offers significant improvements in intrusion detection accuracy.

    Privacy-Preserving: Federated learning ensures data privacy by not requiring raw data sharing.

    Scalability: Effective even when individual datasets are limited, demonstrating robustness across diverse vehicle manufacturers.

Limitations

    Data Heterogeneity: Variations in CAN data across different vehicles may introduce complexities, potentially affecting model convergence and performance.

    Resource Constraints: Requires computational resources for effective model training and aggregation, potentially challenging for smaller-scale manufacturers or less-equipped facilities.

Comparison with Related Work

Unlike traditional transfer learning methods, CANPerFL leverages global knowledge from multiple car manufacturers rather than relying on a single source dataset. It is among the first studies to apply federated learning specifically for IDS in vehicles, emphasizing privacy preservation and performance gains due to knowledge sharing.
Conclusion

CANPerFL demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using personalized federated learning to improve vehicle cybersecurity. Future research directions include integrating Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and further refining the approach to address model variability among different vehicles, thereby broadening its practical application potential
