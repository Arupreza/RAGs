Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of this study is to propose an enhanced intrusion detection system named ECF-IDS for protecting in-vehicle networks, specifically CAN buses, from various cyber-attacks. Motivated by the growing vulnerability of connected vehicles, this system aims to efficiently and accurately detect malicious activities such as denial of service (DoS), fuzzy attacks, gear attacks, and RPM spoofing, ensuring vehicle safety and security.
Working Principle

The core technique of ECF-IDS is based on an Enhanced Cuckoo Filter (ECF) combined with a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) model. ECF is employed to maintain two separate lists (normal and intrusion), quickly identifying known traffic patterns. Ambiguous or conflicting traffic patterns that arise from this initial filtering process are further classified using the sophisticated BERT model.
Workflow

The ECF-IDS workflow involves several key steps:

    Creation of normal and intrusion lists using labeled traffic data through ECF.

    Sequential filtering of incoming CAN traffic against these two lists.

    Identification of ambiguous or conflicting traffic for further analysis.

    Application of the BERT-based IDS model to accurately classify ambiguous traffic.

    Continuous updating of ECF lists based on BERT outcomes to maintain high accuracy.

Methodology

The study employs a combination of unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning for the BERT model. Initially, the ECF algorithm classifies traffic into known normal or intrusion categories. Ambiguous results are fed into a fine-tuned BERT model that has been specifically adapted for binary and multi-classification tasks. This dual-layered methodology optimizes detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
Datasets

Two primary datasets are utilized in this research:

    Car Hacking Dataset (CHD): Contains real-world CAN traffic data representing normal conditions and four types of attacks (DoS, fuzzy, RPM spoofing, gear attacks).

    Can-train-and-test dataset: Includes diverse CAN data from four different vehicle models and multiple drivers, capturing nine attack types in real driving scenarios.

Key Findings

The ECF-IDS achieved exceptional detection results, surpassing traditional algorithms such as k-means, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT). Specifically, it attained over 99% detection success across multiple scenarios. Additionally, real vehicle testing demonstrated near-perfect performance, with accuracy and F1-scores consistently above 99.99%.
Advantages

ECF-IDS offers notable strengths including efficient use of computational resources, high detection speed, and excellent accuracy. The enhanced cuckoo filter significantly reduces computational overhead, while the BERT model robustly handles complex and ambiguous traffic. This combination allows for lightweight yet highly effective real-time intrusion detection suitable for constrained in-vehicle environments.
Limitations

Despite its strengths, ECF-IDS has limitations concerning the initial training phase, requiring substantial computational resources that are not available within typical vehicle hardware configurations. Consequently, the model training must occur offline, necessitating periodic updates from external sources to accommodate emerging threats, which might affect responsiveness to new attack patterns.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to related works (e.g., CANBERT, HyDL-IDS, GIDS, and ResNet-based IDS), ECF-IDS demonstrated comparable or superior performance across multiple attack scenarios. Its major competitive advantage is the combined efficiency of the enhanced cuckoo filter and the robust contextual understanding of the BERT model, enabling faster detection times and lower resource utilization in practical deployments.
Conclusion

The study concludes that the proposed ECF-IDS provides a robust, efficient, and highly accurate intrusion detection capability tailored specifically for vehicle networks. Future directions include developing a cloud-based distributed IDS infrastructure, which would enable continuous, real-time updates and training, enhancing the adaptability and responsiveness of in-vehicle security measures to emerging cyber threats.
