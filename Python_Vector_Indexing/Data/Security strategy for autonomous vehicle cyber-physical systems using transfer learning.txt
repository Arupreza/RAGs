Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of the study is to enhance the security of autonomous vehicle cyber-physical systems (AV-CPS) by detecting cyberattacks targeting physical components via the Controller Area Network (CAN). This research specifically proposes an Intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IIDS) utilizing transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs to effectively identify cyber threats in real-time, aiming to improve the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.
Working Principle

The study employs transfer learning, using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect anomalies indicative of cyberattacks. The method involves converting real-time sensor data and control signals into image representations, which are then classified as normal or anomalous by CNN models. This leverages pre-existing deep learning models trained on large datasets to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
Workflow

The workflow consists of three main stages: First, an autonomous vehicle simulation integrating CAN communication is established. Next, the dataset is generated under normal and attack conditions, converting one-dimensional signals into images. Lastly, these images are used as inputs for training, validation, and testing using various pre-trained CNN models to perform intrusion detection.
Methodology

The methodology involves:

    Implementing the CAN communication protocol using Simulink within an AV simulation environment.

    Generating a dataset from AV simulations, incorporating normal and cyberattack-induced anomalies.

    Preprocessing sensor data into image formats suitable for deep learning.

    Applying transfer learning through eight CNN models (InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet).

Datasets

The study utilizes a custom-generated dataset derived from a simulated AV-CPS environment. The dataset consists of balanced instances totaling 80,000 samples, equally divided between normal operational data and data reflecting anomalies induced by simulated cyberattacks. Features include vehicle positions and velocities for both ego and lead vehicles.
Key Findings

The key finding is that among the tested CNN models, GoogLeNet provided the best performance for intrusion detection, achieving an F1-score of 99.47%. The evaluation demonstrated that transfer learning effectively leveraged existing CNN models, significantly improving intrusion detection accuracy within AV systems.
Advantages

The study's approach offers high detection accuracy, low computational overhead due to the use of transfer learning, and scalability to different CPS applications. By utilizing pre-trained CNNs, it circumvents the resource-intensive process of training deep learning models from scratch, enabling faster and more effective implementation in real-time security scenarios.
Limitations

One significant limitation is that the intrusion detection system focuses exclusively on data received from compromised sensors through the CAN protocol, potentially missing cyberattacks originating from other vehicle subsystems. Additionally, the study employs simulated data, and real-world validation could present different challenges and performance characteristics.
Comparison with Related Work

The paper compares its method favorably to existing machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Unlike traditional IDSs, which often depend on manual feature selection and complex preprocessing, the proposed approach streamlines preprocessing by automatically converting signals into images, allowing CNNs to detect complex patterns with minimal manual intervention. It outperformed other recent methods tested on similar autonomous vehicle scenarios.
Conclusion

The study concludes that transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs provides a highly effective intrusion detection mechanism for AV-CPS. Future research directions include expanding detection capabilities beyond sensor data, addressing real-world deployment challenges, and adapting the proposed architecture to other CPS domains like drones and smart gridsâ€‹
