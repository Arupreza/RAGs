Main Idea and Purpose:

The primary goal of this study is to develop CANShield, a robust intrusion detection system (IDS) designed specifically for Controller Area Networks (CAN) at the signal level. The motivation behind this work is addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in automotive networks, where traditional methods fail to detect complex signal-level intrusions effectively. CANShield leverages deep learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and reliability.
Working Principle:

CANShield operates by analyzing signal-level features extracted from CAN data to identify anomalies indicative of cyberattacks. The core mechanisms employed are based on deep neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to model temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics within the CAN signals, improving the detection capability of subtle and complex intrusions.
Workflow:

The workflow of CANShield includes four major steps: (1) Signal extraction, where raw CAN data is processed into meaningful signals; (2) Feature representation, where signals are formatted into structured inputs suitable for deep learning models; (3) Training of the deep learning models (CNN-LSTM) to recognize patterns of normal and malicious behavior; and (4) Deployment of the trained model for real-time intrusion detection in vehicle CAN networks.
Methodology:

CANShield employs a hybrid deep learning architecture combining CNN and LSTM networks. The CNN component extracts spatial features from signal-level data, while the LSTM component captures sequential temporal dependencies. A supervised learning approach was utilized, involving the labeling of CAN signals as either normal or anomalous, to effectively train the model. Various hyperparameters were optimized to enhance performance and accuracy.
Datasets:

The study utilized publicly available CAN datasets, including the "Car-Hacking Dataset," which contains normal and attack scenarios such as DoS, fuzzing, and spoofing attacks. These datasets provided diverse examples of both legitimate and malicious CAN signal patterns necessary to train, validate, and test the CANShield model comprehensively.
Key Findings:

The study found that CANShield significantly outperformed traditional and existing intrusion detection methods in detecting signal-level intrusions within CAN networks. Specifically, the CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall rates across various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness in distinguishing complex cyber threats from normal vehicle operations effectively.
Advantages:

CANShield's key advantages include high detection accuracy, the ability to identify subtle and sophisticated signal-level intrusions, and robustness to varied attack types. Its deep-learning-based architecture enables effective capture of temporal and spatial relationships within CAN data, providing improved protection against advanced cyber threats that traditional IDS methods struggle to detect accurately.
Limitations:

Despite its strengths, CANShield has some limitations, including the reliance on labeled training data, which can be resource-intensive to acquire. Furthermore, the computational requirements of deep learning models may impose constraints in real-time deployment within resource-constrained automotive embedded systems, potentially necessitating optimization or lightweight model designs for practical implementations.
Comparison with Related Work:

Compared to existing CAN IDS solutions, which typically operate at the message-level, CANShieldâ€™s signal-level approach demonstrates superior accuracy and effectiveness in detecting nuanced intrusions. Prior research largely overlooked detailed signal-level anomalies, limiting their capability in identifying sophisticated attacks. CANShield addresses these gaps, enhancing cybersecurity effectiveness within automotive CAN networks.
Conclusion:

The final takeaways of the study indicate that CANShield significantly advances the capability of automotive cybersecurity through its deep-learning-based intrusion detection at the signal level. Future research directions proposed include optimizing the model for real-time efficiency, exploring unsupervised learning methods to reduce dependency on labeled datasets, and extending the framework to other in-vehicle communication protocols beyond CAN.
