Main Idea and Purpose

The primary goal of the study is to address the lack of standardized, comprehensive, and publicly available datasets for automotive intrusion detection systems (IDS) on Controller Area Networks (CAN). The motivation arises from the need to facilitate fair comparisons among IDS models, providing reliable benchmarks and supporting reproducible research. The curated dataset, named CAN-Train-and-Test, serves to improve automotive cybersecurity research by enabling consistent and accurate model training and evaluation.
Working Principle

The study curates a comprehensive dataset structured to cover diverse attack types and vehicle scenarios, enhancing realism in cybersecurity experiments. The dataset includes normal and attack traffic clearly categorized into various subsets (training and testing). It integrates a broad spectrum of known attacks—Denial of Service, Fuzzing, Spoofing, and others—captured from multiple vehicle models, facilitating robustness and generalizability of intrusion detection methods.
Workflow

The workflow followed involves multiple stages: data acquisition from actual vehicles, attack simulation and data recording under controlled conditions, careful preprocessing and labeling of CAN frames, dataset partitioning into training and testing subsets, and evaluation. Each dataset subset is carefully curated to cover specific scenarios such as known vehicle attacks, unknown vehicle attacks, and attack-free traffic conditions to support diverse experimental setups.
Methodology

The methodology employed encompasses real-world CAN data collection from various vehicles (Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Traverse, Chevrolet Silverado, Subaru Forester), rigorous simulation of intrusion scenarios, and meticulous labeling of CAN data for supervised learning tasks. They also define clear specifications for CAN frame structures, categorization of attacks, and establish detailed guidelines on using dataset partitions for model training, validation, and testing.
Datasets

The dataset provided by this study is named "CAN-Train-and-Test" and includes extensive CAN traffic data collected from several vehicles, covering both normal driving scenarios and simulated cyber-attacks. Vehicles used include the Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Traverse, Chevrolet Silverado, and Subaru Forester, encompassing multiple attack types (e.g., DoS, Fuzzing, Spoofing). The data is structured into subsets to test IDS under various scenarios, enhancing experimental flexibility and reliability.
Key Findings

A key finding is the recognition that existing automotive intrusion detection datasets often lack standardization, hindering reproducibility and comparability of IDS methods. The study provides insights into dataset imbalance issues and presents solutions via carefully structured subsets. It highlights the necessity of diverse and realistic traffic conditions, demonstrating that IDS trained on diverse datasets show improved robustness and generalization capabilities.
Advantages

The advantages include providing a standardized, publicly available, and extensive dataset, enabling reproducibility in automotive cybersecurity research. It addresses prior shortcomings by introducing structured subsets explicitly designed for robust model evaluation. The realistic diversity in attack types and vehicle conditions within the dataset significantly improves the applicability and practical relevance of experimental findings.
Limitations

A notable limitation is the inherent dataset imbalance due to fewer occurrences of attack instances compared to normal traffic, potentially biasing model performance. Additionally, although diverse, the dataset is limited to specific vehicle models, which may affect generalization to vehicles with significantly different CAN architectures. Moreover, the simulated nature of attacks, while realistic, might not capture all nuances of real-world intrusion scenarios.
Comparison with Related Work

Compared to prior datasets, this study explicitly addresses issues of reproducibility, comparability, and experimental robustness by clearly defining subsets and scenarios for testing and training. It surpasses previous efforts by providing a detailed breakdown of attack types, structured labeling, and extensive documentation, facilitating easier adoption and use by researchers aiming for rigorous IDS evaluation.
Conclusion

The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of structured and standardized datasets for advancing automotive cybersecurity research. It recommends expanding the diversity of vehicles and attack scenarios in future datasets, stressing continual updates and maintenance to reflect evolving automotive threats. Future directions include using CAN-Train-and-Test as a benchmark to develop more sophisticated IDS models capable of adaptive detection in evolving automotive environments.
