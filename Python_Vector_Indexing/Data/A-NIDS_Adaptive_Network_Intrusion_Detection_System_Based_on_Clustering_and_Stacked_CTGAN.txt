Main Idea and Purpose:

The primary goal of the study is to develop an Adaptive Network Intrusion Detection System (A-NIDS) capable of handling data drift, catastrophic forgetting, and real-time detection performance issues commonly faced in traditional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The motivation arises from the reality that network environments continuously change, leading to data drift which traditional static models fail to manage effectively.
Working Principle:

A-NIDS utilizes three integrated modules: the Detection Module, the Adaptive Module, and the Generation Module. The Detection Module employs a shallow neural network optimized for real-time performance. The Adaptive Module utilizes clustering algorithms to detect data drift adaptively. The Generation Module leverages a stacked Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (Stacked CTGAN) to generate synthetic data, addressing issues of catastrophic forgetting and historical data storage costs.
Workflow:

The process begins with initial training of models on historical data. Real-time network traffic is captured via a sliding window mechanism and continuously evaluated by the Adaptive Module for data drift. Upon detecting drift, the Generation Module generates synthetic old data. The synthetic data is then combined with new data to retrain the Detection Module, which updates to accommodate new data distributions while retaining past knowledge.
Methodology:

The Detection Module uses a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) for efficient real-time classification. The Adaptive Module uses K-means clustering and outlier analysis to detect data drift in an unsupervised manner. The Generation Module employs a modified CTGAN approach called Stacked-CTGAN, designed to accurately capture both global and local feature distributions of the original data.
Datasets:

The study utilizes two widely recognized cybersecurity datasets: CICIDS-2017 and CSE-CICIDS-2018. These datasets contain diverse network traffic, including benign traffic and multiple attack types such as DoS, DDoS, FTP, SSH brute force, and botnet attacks, which simulate realistic network scenarios and enable thorough evaluation of the proposed method.
Key Findings:

Experimental results demonstrate that A-NIDS significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving high accuracy and recall for both new and historical data. Specifically, A-NIDS maintains low false positive and negative rates (FPR and FNR), effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting, and adapts well to new, previously unseen attacks. The system shows excellent real-time performance, with detection latency around 5 microseconds.
Advantages:

A-NIDS effectively handles dynamic data environments through adaptive drift detection, significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting via generative replay of old data. It achieves robust detection performance and maintains excellent real-time responsiveness due to its lightweight neural network architecture. The system's modular design also enhances scalability and ease of updating.
Limitations:

While A-NIDS can detect data drift adaptively, it still requires labeled new data to retrain the detection module, necessitating domain expert intervention for labeling new data. The interpretability of decisions made by the deep learning models remains limited, potentially reducing user trust in certain operational scenarios. Also, performance relies heavily on quality training data, which can be challenging to acquire.
Comparison with Related Work:

Compared to traditional signature and rule-based methods, as well as advanced deep learning-based NIDS, A-NIDS uniquely integrates adaptive data drift detection and generative replay methods. Unlike previous methods that assume static distributions or ignore real-time constraints, A-NIDS provides a balanced solution for adaptive updating, catastrophic forgetting, and real-time performance, showing superior versatility and robustness.
Conclusion:

A-NIDS represents a significant advancement in intrusion detection technology, addressing key real-world issues of adaptive drift detection, catastrophic forgetting, and real-time responsiveness. Future work directions include enhancing model interpretability, improving zero-day attack detection performance, and acquiring realistic datasets from diverse and complex network environments for further validation and development.
